# bevy_multicam
An easy plug-n-play multifunctional camera that allows for easy setup of camera for a scene.

Add a few lines of code to your existing project allows you to test a wide variety of cameras by attaching it to
your player entity or the default spaceship entity. 

Inspired by [bevy_flycam](https://github.com/sburris0/bevy_flycam), this camera is fairly simple but should be a neat help for developers looking for a camera implementation without going the hassle of reinventing the wheel.
