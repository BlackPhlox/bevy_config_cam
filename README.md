# bevy_multicam
One-stop-shop to finding the right type of camera for your project

# Use-case
_I've don't got time to program a camera to find out its not what I'm looking for._</br></br>
Adding a few lines of code allows you to test a wide variety of cameras by attaching it to
your player entity or the default spaceship entity. 

# Caveman-Introduction

Me had no cam in default bevy, me look for cam lib, me found many.</br>
Me liked [bevy_flycam](https://github.com/sburris0/bevy_flycam), me contributed examples and CI.</br>
But me wanted more flexiblity, so me made my own with many different types of cameras.</br>
Got something working but me no good at rust, if you have time and passion, plz help.
